**🌸 Task 2 – Iris Flower Classification**

This project was developed as part of the CodSoft Internship on Data Science. The goal is to classify Iris flowers into different species using a machine learning model trained on sepal and petal measurements.




**🎯 Objective**

* The Iris dataset consists of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
* These can be classified based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
* The objective of this task is to train a machine learning model that learns from these measurements and accurately predicts the species of new flower samples.
* This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.




**🏁 Goal**

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Through this task, the project aims to:

* Understand and apply the end-to-end machine learning workflow (data loading → cleaning → visualization → model building → evaluation).
* Practice and strengthen skills in data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and model training.
* Gain experience in visualizing feature relationships to extract insights.
* Learn to evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
* Demonstrate the ability to solve a real-world classification problem using Python and ML libraries.




**📌 Key Points**

* Part of CodSoft’s Data Science Internship - Task 3
* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
* Visualized the dataset using multiple advanced plots
* Built a classification model using Logistic Regression

**📊 About Plots**

This project includes rich data visualization to understand feature patterns:

* Line Plot: Compares mean feature values for each species
* Bar Chart: Shows sample count per species
* Box Plot: Displays distribution and outliers for features
* Strip Plot: Visualizes individual sample spread by species
* Pair Plot: Shows pairwise feature relationships for class separation
* Feature-wise Distribution: Histograms showing value spread for each feature
